            Cubbon Park dons many hats: a green lung in the heart of the city that also hosts a library, museums, a tennis academy, an aquarium, a toy train and many statues and pavilions. It’s probably one of the only parks to have a busy road cutting through it. In the wee hours of the morning or evenings, it’s a jogger’s paradise. Spring adds to the beauty of this park, with the lovely and colorful Tabebuia trees in full bloom.
